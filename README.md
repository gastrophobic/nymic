# Nymic üîç

A fast Roblox username availability checker with a live grayscale console output.  

Nymic generates usernames in modes like words, digits, random combos, and barcodes, checks availability via the Roblox signup API, logs them in real time with a **dark-gray ‚Üî white looping gradient**, and saves results to text files.

- Animated grayscale console log (dark gray ‚Üí white ‚Üí dark gray)
- Results saved per mode (.txt files) and a `failed.txt` for taken names

- One-click Windows launcher (`run.bat`): auto-installs Python + dependencies
